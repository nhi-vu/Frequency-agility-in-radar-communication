# Frequency-agility-in-radar-communication

Using frequency agility in radar model receivers for counterting the signals generated from interference sources, reducing repeat signals and helping support effective operations of these systems. 

In this project, applying frequency agility improve frequency hopping waveform and verifies and the radar system to identify the true target echo without being confused by the jamming signal.
